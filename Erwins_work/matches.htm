</li>

<li>
Furthermore
,
we
find
that

The

Difficulties

is
to

and

all
under

</li>

<li>
Conservation
agriculture
represents
a
set
of
three
crop
management
principles
that
has
received
strong
international
support
to
help
address
this
challenge
,
with
recent
conservation
agriculture
efforts
focusing
on
smallholder
farming
systems
in
sub-Saharan
Africa
and
South
Asia
.
</li>

<li>
However
,
conservation
agriculture
is
highly
debated
,
with
respect
to
both
its
effects
on
crop
yields
and
its
applicability
in
different
farming
contexts
.
</li>

<li>
Here
we
conduct
a
global
meta-analysis
using
5,463
paired
yield
observations
from
610
studies
to
compare
no-till
,
the
original
and
central
concept
of
conservation
agriculture
,
with
conventional
tillage
practices
across
48
crops
and
63
countries
.
</li>

<li>
Overall
,
our
results
show
that
no-till
reduces
<a style="color: blue; font-weight: bold" title="template = OBJ_reduce
variable = yields">
yields
</a>
,
yet
this
response
is
variable
and
under
certain
conditions
no-till
can
produce
equivalent
or
greater
yields
than
conventional
tillage
.
</li>

<li>
Importantly
,
when
no-till
is
combined
with
the
other
two
conservation
agriculture
principles
of
residue
retention
and
crop
rotation
,
<a style="color: blue; font-weight: bold" title="template = SUBJ_minimize
variable = its negative impacts">
its
negative
impacts
</a>
are
minimized
.
</li>

<li>
Moreover
,
no-till
in
combination
with
the
other
two
principles
significantly
increases
<a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" title="template = OBJ_increase

,
suggesting
that
it
may
become
an

ever-drier
regions
of
the
world
.
</li>

<li>
However
,
any
expansion
of
<a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" title="template = PCOMP_expand

conservation
agriculture
</a>
should
be
done
with
caution
in

,
as

other
two

often
challenging
in
resource-poor
and
vulnerable
smallholder
farming
systems
,
thereby
increasing

</li>

<li>
Although
farming
systems
are
multifunctional
,
and
environmental
and
socio-economic
factors
need
to
be
considered
,
our
analysis
indicates
that
the
potential
contribution
of
no-till
to
the
sustainable
intensification
of
agriculture
is
more
limited
than
often
assumed
.

Decades
of
intensive
work
on

change
have
done
little
to
narrow
the
range
of
uncertainty
over
Earth
's
climate
sensitivity
--
the
amount
of
global
warming
to
be
expected
under
carbon

levels
twice
those
of

pre-industrial
world
,
which
the
Intergovernmental

on

Change
puts
at

2
degreesC
and
4.5

</li>

<li>
Nor
can
a

estimate
be
expected
in

according
to
Gerard
Roe
and
Marcia
Baker
of

</li>

<li>
Their
mathematical
analysis
stresses
that
normally

uncertainties
in
the

associated
with

processes
make
ruling
out
a

by
the

</li>

<li>
It
is
generally
believed
that
banded

precipitated
from
an
ocean
whose
bottom

contained
significant
concentrations
of
dissolved

iron

and
that
this

terminated
when

developed

oxidizing
the

thus
removing
it

<li>
In

For

.
</li>

<li>
Primary
productivity
over

<li>
Such

<li>
Additionally

Holocene
times
</li>

<li>
Recent
studies
of
the
Greenland
ice
cores
have
offered
many
insights
into
Holocene
climatic
dynamics
at
decadal
to
century
timescales
.
</li>

<li>
Despite
the
abundance
of
continental
records
of
Holocene
climate
,
few
have
sufficient
chronological
control
and
sampling
resolution
to
compare
with
the
Greenland
findings
.
</li>

<li>
Butannually
laminated
sediments
(
varves
)
from
lakes
can
provide
high-resolution
continental
palaeoclimate
data
with
secure
chronologies
.
</li>

<li>
Here
we
present
analyses
of
varved
sediments
from
Deep
Lake
in
Minnesota
,
USA
.
</li>

<li>
Trends
in
the
stable
oxygen-isotope
composition
of
the
sedimentary
carbonate
indicate
a
pronounced
climate
cooling
from
8.9
to
8.3
kyr
before

probably

</li>

<li>
The
abrupt
onset
of
this
climate
reversal
,
over
several
decades
,
was
probably
caused
by
a
reorganization
of
atmospheric
circulation
and
cooling
of
the
Arctic
airmass
in
summer
that
resulted
from
the
final
collapse
of
the
Laurentide
ice
near
Hudson
Bay
and
the
discharge
of
icebergs
from
the
Quebec
and
Keewatin
centres
into
the
Tyrell
Sea
.
</li>

<li>
The
timing
and
duration
of
this
climate
reversal
suggest
that
it
is
distinct
from
the
prominent
widespread
cold
snap
that
occurred
8,200

ago
in
Greenland
and
other

climate
reversals
occurred
between
9,000

Coherent
ecological
dynamics
induced
by
large-scale
disturbance
</li>

<li>
Aggregate
community-level
response
to
disturbance
is
a
principle
concern
in
ecology
because
post-disturbance
dynamics
are
integral
to
the
ability
of
ecosystems
to
maintain
function
in
an
uncertain
world
.
</li>

<li>
Community-level
responses
to
disturbance
can
be
arrayed
along
a
spectrum
ranging
from
synchronous
oscillations
where
<a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" title="template = SUBJ_rise

<li>
An

that

patterns
of
synchrony

</a>
can
vary

can
enable
detection

coherent

that
would
otherwise
be
obscured

occurring

</li>

<li>
Here
I
show
that
application
of
wavelet
analysis
to
experimentally
manipulated
plankton
communities
reveals
strong
synchrony
after
disturbance

</li>

<li>
The
result
is
paradoxical
because
it
is
well
established
that
these
communities
contain
both
disturbance-sensitive
and
disturbance-tolerant
species
leading
to
compensation
within
functional
groups
.
</li>

<li>
Theory
predicts
that
compensatory
substitution
of
functionally
equivalent
species
should
stabilize
ecological
communities
,
yet
I
found
at
the
whole-community

These

to
consider
not

complementarity
in

increases
progressively
along
the
hierarchy
of
organizational
levels
(
that
is
,
from
species
to
functional
group
to
whole
community
)
;
and
finally
,
that
the
community-level
stability
seems
to
arise
from
compensatory
interactions
among
major
components
at
both
species
and
functional
group
levels
.
</li>

<li>
From
a
hierarchical
perspective
,
our
results
corroborate
some
previous
findings

compensatory
effects
.
</li>

<li>
Undisturbed

steppe
ecosystems
seem
to
culminate
with
high
biodiversity

productivity
and
ecosystem
stability
concurrently

</li>

<li>
Because
these
relationships

correlational
,
further

are
necessary
to

the
causation
among
these
factors

The

</li>

<li>
Statistical
studies
of
rainfed
maize
yields
in
the
United
States
and
elsewhere
have
indicated
two
clear
features
:
a
strong
negative

and
a

rainfall
.
</li>

<li>
Here
we

that
the

Agricultural

is
able
to
reproduce
both

in

Midwestern

provide
insight
into
underlying
mechanisms
.
</li>

<li>

The

The

<li>
Our

<li>
Of

Whether

ATP

source
in

<li>
For

there

,
which

</li>

<li>
The

to
produce
NADPH
from

is
the

</li>

<li>
Although

In

</li>

<li>
Surprisingly

a

<li>
Moreover

</li>

<li>
As

confirmation

In

A
constructive
scheme
unravelled
?
</li>

<li>
The
Collapse
of
the
Kyoto
Protocol
is
a
serious
,
detailed
,
but
ultimately
paradoxical
book
.
</li>

<li>
Apart
from
the
introductory
chapter
--
which
contains
some
misleading
caricatures
about
the
Kyoto
Protocol
,
the
international
agreement
that
set
targets
for
greenhouse-gas
emissions
--
it
is
written
with
an
authority
and
detail
that
few
can
muster
.
</li>

<li>
It
is
also
an
absolutely
independent
assessment
,
beholden
to
no
one
.
</li>

<li>
Yet
the
core
conclusion
reveals
a
fundamental
inconsistency
in
the
analysis
.
</li>

<li>
David
Victor
gives
short
shrift
to
many
of
the
sacred
cows
of
US
opposition
to
the
protocol
.
</li>

<li>
Whereas
most
US
criticisms
centre
on
the
lack
of
quantified
commitments
for
developing
countries
,
Victor
argues
the
opposite
,
that
the
commitments
should
have
focused
only
on
the
rich
countries
of
the
OECD
.
</li>

<li>
It
would
then
have
avoided
<a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" title="template = SUBJ_raise
variable = the institutional difficulties">
the
institutional
difficulties
</a>
raised
particularly
by
including
Russia
and
Ukraine
.
</li>

<li>
Most
US
economists
argue
that
Kyoto
's
targets
are
too
close
,
but
Victor
says
they
should
have
been
closer
,
to
minimize
<a style="color: blue; font-weight: bold" title="template = OBJ_minimize
variable = the uncertainties">
the
uncertainties
</a>
.
</li>

<li>
Kyoto
's
targets
cover
many
different
gases
;
whereas
opponents
want
the
effort
to
focus
more
on
gases
other
than
carbon
dioxide
,
Victor
says
the
targets
should
have
been
restricted
to
carbon
dioxide
only
,
because
it
is
hard
to
monitor
the
others
properly
.
</li>

<li>
The
core
of
Victor
's
analysis
is
thus
an
institutional
critique
,
particularly
with
respect
to
emissions
trading
--
the
option
for
countries
to
trade
their
emissions
allowances
.
</li>

<li>
Trading
,
he
rightly
asserts
,
is
an
inevitable
consequence
of
adopting
emissions
targets
.
</li>

<li>
Yet
he
believes
that
bringing
money
into
emissions
control
will
create
incentives
to
cheat
the
system
that
will
exacerbate
the
already
difficult
problems
of
monitoring
and
enforcement
.
</li>

<li>
He
also
claims
that
,
although
Kyoto
's
flexibilities
would
allow
the
United
States
to
meet
its
commitment
through
investing
in
emission
reduction
projects
or
systems
abroad
,
the
foreign
institutions
concerned
may
not
be
able
to
guarantee
that
this
will
really
reduce
<a style="color: blue; font-weight: bold" title="template = OBJ_reduce
variable = emissions">
emissions
</a>
elsewhere
.
</li>

<li>
Victor
's
book
is
built
on
years
of
experience
and
commentary
on
the
climate-change
regime
.
</li>

<li>
He
has
always
been
a
critic
of
the
targets-and-trading
approach
,
and
sees
the
collapse
of
the
recent
talks
in
The
Hague
as
vindicating
his
stance
.
</li>

<li>
But
his
final
chapter
marks
an
important
evolution
in
<a style="color: green; font-weight: bold" title="template = PCOMP_evolve
variable = his thinking">
his
thinking
</a>
.
</li>

<li>
Previously
,
he
argued
for
a
soft-law
approach
based
on
national
reporting
and
review
--
a
climate
equivalent
of
the
OECD
's
economic
review
process
.
</li>

<li>
Here
he
acknowledges
that
something
stronger
is
needed
.
</li>

<li>
The
answer
?
</li>

<li>
A
mix
of
targets-and-trading
with
a
tax
system
that
sets
a
limit
on
the
market
price
of
emission
permits
.
</li>

<li>
Putting
a
cap
on
permit
prices
and
restricting
the
system
to
carbon
dioxide
in
the
OECD
countries
,
he
argues
,
would
overcome
the
institutional
difficulties
he
has
identified
.
</li>

<li>
But
one
senses
an
air
of
desperation
.
</li>

<li>
By
the
end
of
the
book
Victor
has
argued
himself
into
supporting
many
of
the
Kyoto
Protocol
's
fundamental
principles
.
</li>

<li>
The
problems
he
identifies
are
not
unmanageable
,
and
the
changes
he
seeks
are
relatively
minor
compared
with
the
prospect
of
negotiating
an
entirely
new
system
.
</li>

<li>
But
as
a
long-standing
critic
,
he
can
not
bear
to
recognize
that
.
</li>

<li>
He
would
rather
tear
down
the
house
and
start
again
according
to
his
own
specifications
.
</li>

<li>
Despite
all
its
important
insights
,
its
ultimate
negativity
--
and
political
naivete
--
makes
this
a
depressing
book
.
</li>

<li>
For
example
,
the
difficulty
of
monitoring
methane
emissions
does
not
preclude
keeping
the
Kyoto
basket
of
gases
for
national
targets
,
while
domestic
policies
target
carbon
dioxide
and
other
gases
separately
.
</li>

<li>
Monitoring
need
not
involve
unacceptably
intrusive
international
inspection
;
a
reasonable
degree
of
democracy
and
transparency
could
minimize
<a style="color: blue; font-weight: bold" title="template = OBJ_minimize
variable = the scope for abuse">
the
scope
for
abuse
</a>
.
</li>

<li>
Victor
complains
that
no
one
compared
the
benefits
of
including
methane
against
the
costs
of
(
imperfect
)
monitoring
,
but
he
makes
no
attempt
to
compare
such
costs
with
his
own
alternative
of
abandoning
the
protocol
along
with
the
whole
idea
of
cost-effectiveness
across
the
different
gases
.
</li>

<li>
Victor
's
analytical
strength
and
peculiar
negativity
are
nowhere
more
striking
than
in
his
treatment
of
liability
.
</li>

<li>
He
knows
that
emissions
trading
can
do
much
to
solve
the
thorny
problem
of
compliance
,
provided
that
the
validity
of
acquired
emission
allowances
is
made
dependent
on
the
selling
country
complying
with
its
commitments
(
`
buyer
liability
'
)
.
</li>

<li>
The
alternative
of
seller
liability
``
invites
disaster
...
it
will
fail
because
it
is
a
fiction
in
international
law
''
.
</li>

<li>
With
buyer
liability
,
however
,
selling
countries
would
not
get
a
good
price
unless
they
could
convince
the
countries
interested
in
buying
that
they
have
both
the
systems
and
the
intent
to
comply
.
</li>

<li>
Indeed
,
the
case
Victor
presents
for
such
buyer
liability
is
unanswerable
and
unsurpassed
in
the
whole
of
the
literature
.
</li>

<li>
Yet
he
then
meekly
notes
that
the
``
international
debate
''
(
actually
the
US
position
)
at
The
Hague
conference
supported
seller
liability
.
</li>

<li>
He
could
have
castigated
the
previous
US
administration
for
its
cowardice
and
lack
of
imagination
on
the
issue
,
and
argued
passionately
that
the
rescheduling
of
the
suspended
Hague
talks
offers
the
world
a
chance
to
get
this
cornerstone
of
international
emissions
trading
on
the
right
footing
.
</li>

<li>
Instead
,
he
simply
concludes
that
the
protocol
is
hopeless
,
but
that
if
the
world
starts
again
with
his
own
scheme
,
it
will
get
the
liability
rules
right
.
</li>

<li>
There
are
too
many
such
inconsistencies
between
Victor
's
critique
of
trading
in
the
protocol
and
his
endorsement
of
trading
according
to
his
scheme
.
</li>

<li>
This
is
coupled
with
the
casual
assumption
that
the
Kyoto
deal
can
be
completely
rewritten
.
</li>

<li>
Victor
vastly
underestimates
Kyoto
's
achievement
in
obtaining
agreement
and
the
centrality
of
the
strong
US
target
in
return
for
extensive
flexibilities
.
</li>

<li>
Indeed
,
despite
its
analytical
depth
,
the
book
is
marred
--
and
perhaps
the
negativity
explained
--
by
viewing
everything
through
a
US
lens
.
</li>

<li>
This
results
in
scepticism
about
US
implementation
and
cynicism
about
the
rest
of
the
world
.
</li>

<li>
For
example
,
it
is
grossly
misleading
to
assert
that
``
no
major
government
has
a
viable
plan
for
compliance
''
.
</li>

<li>
Ten
years
in
advance
of
the
Kyoto
target
period
(
2008-12
)
,
the
United
Kingdom
is
on
track
,
and
,
like
many
other
European
governments
,
if
its
current
plans
prove
inadequate
,
<a style="color: red; font-weight: bold" title="template = SUBJ_strengthen
variable = they">
they
</a>
will
be
strengthened
and/or
supplemented
by
using
Kyoto
's
mechanisms
to
achieve
compliance
.
</li>

<li>
There
are
other
peculiar
inconsistencies
.
</li>

<li>
At
the
core
of
his
attack
on
emissions
trading
is
the
assertion
that
negotiating
allocations
is
the
equivalent
of
agreeing
on
how
to
distribute
money
,
and
is
hence
impossible
,
or
too
weak
.
</li>

<li>
Yet
Kyoto
did
reach
agreement
--
Victor
's
claim
that
all
this
was
an
accident
born
of
governmental
ignorance
is
arrogant
and
does
not
hold
water
.
</li>

<li>
And
his
complaint
about
Kyoto
is
that
the
targets
are
too
strong
.
</li>

<li>
Indeed
,
in
the
United
Nations
,
the
European
Union
,
and
even
in
individual
governments
,
negotiations
regularly
distribute
budgets
.
</li>

<li>
All
that
is
needed
is
the
common
understanding
that
there
is
a
collective
interest
in
agreeing
,
and
that
simply
printing
more
money
only
leads
to
inflation.Victor
has
not
factored
in
the
politics
of
pressure
in
the
hothouse
of
negotiating
allocations
.
</li>

<li>
It
is
the
achievement
of
having
agreed
in
Kyoto
that
Victor
wants
to
unravel
.
</li>

<li>
Ultimately
,
Victor
's
book
reminds
me
of
Tolkien
's
Lord
Denethor
in
The
Lord
of
the
Rings
,
who
was
given
a
crystal
ball
to
see
events
around
the
world
--
but
only
negative
ones
.
</li>

<li>
Overwhelmed
with
despair
,
he
led
his
family
to
the
pyre
,
decrying
the
ignorant
fools
who
fought
on
.
</li>

<li>
He
burnt
to
death
just
as
his
allies
were
mustering
for
their
final
victory
.
</li>

<li>
David
Victor
's
analysis
is
that
of
a
fine
mind
overwhelmed
by
the
problems
he
sees
and
led
to
a
destructive
conclusion
.
</li>

<li>
Nevertheless
,
the
book
should
be
read
by
all
policy-makers
attempting
to
find
international
solutions
to
the
climate
problem
.
</li>

<li>
It
identifies
the
important
questions
to
be
answered
,
and
the
big
problems
to
be
solved
.
</li>

<li>
There
are
answers
,
and
ironically
,
some
may
be
easier
to
find
while
the
present
US
administration
is
withdrawn
from
the
Kyoto
negotiations
.

<li>
The

represent
the
only
pathway
that
connects

therefore
play
a

A

<li>

There

</li>

<li>
One
way
of
accounting
for

carbon

concentrations
during

is
by
invoking

hypothesis
,

</li>

<li>
As
discussed

,
this
hypothesis
assumes
that

also
allowing

,
which
is
consistent
with

.

<li>

Large-scale

</li>

<li>
This
happened
about
40
Myr
after
simple
leafless
vascular
plants
first
colonized
the
land
in
the
Late
Silurian/Early
Devonian
,
but
the
reason
for
the
slow
emergence
of
this
common
feature
of
present-day
plants
is
presently
unresolved
.
</li>

<li>
Here
we
show
,
in
a
series
of
quantitative
analyses
using
fossil
leaf
characters
and
biophysical
principles
,
that
the
delay
was
causally
linked
with
a
90
%
drop
in
atmospheric
pCO2
during
the
Late
Palaeozoic
era
.
</li>

<li>
In
contrast
to
simulations
for
a
typical
Early
Devonian
land
plant
,
possessing
few
stomata
on
leafless
stems
,
those
for
a
planate
leaf
with
the
same
stomatal
characteristics
indicate
that
it
would
have
suffered
lethal
overheating
,
because
of
greater
interception
of
solar
energy
and
low
transpiration
.
</li>

<li>
When
planate
leaves
first
appeared
in
the
Late
Devonian
and
subsequently
diversified
in
the
Carboniferous
period
,
they
possessed
substantially
higher
stomatal
densities
.
</li>

<li>
This
observation
is
consistent
with
the
effects
of
the
pCO2
on
stomatal
development
and
suggests
that
the
evolution
of
<a style="color: green; font-weight: bold" title="template = PCOMP_evolve

The

poses
significant
difficulties
for

One

<li>
To

this
,
we

internationally
important
bird
populations

<li>
Using

degreesC

<li>
The

that

the

In

we

</li>

<li>
In

we

<li>
Using

Drought-induced

<li>
Peatlands

organic
carbon
,
amounting

approximately
455
Pg
.
</li>

<li>
Carbon
builds
up
in

microbial
activity

therefore

The

remain

to
the
