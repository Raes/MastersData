00093#10.1038#ismej.2011.182 Heterotrophic organisms dominate nitrogen fixation in the [MISC South Pacific] [LOC Gyre] Oceanic subtropical gyres are considered biological deserts because of the extremely low availability of nutrients and thus minimum productivities . The major source of nutrient nitrogen in these ecosystems is N2-fixation . The [MISC South Pacific] [ORG Gyre] ( [ORG SPG] ) is the largest ocean gyre in the world , but measurements of N2-fixation therein , or identification of microorganisms involved , are scarce . In the 2006/2007 austral summer , we investigated nitrogen and carbon assimilation at 11 stations throughout the [ORG SPG] . In the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the [ORG SPG] , the chlorophyll maxima reached as deep as 200 m . Surface primary production seemed limited by nitrogen , as dissolved inorganic carbon uptake was stimulated upon additions of 15N-labeled ammonium and leucine in our incubation experiments . N2-fixation was detectable throughout the upper 200 m at most stations , with rates ranging from 0.001 to 0.19 nM N h-1 . N2-fixation in the [ORG SPG] may account for the production of 8-20% of global oceanic new nitrogen . Interestingly , comparable 15N2-fixation rates were measured under light and dark conditions . Meanwhile , phylogenetic analyses for the functional gene biomarker nifH and its transcripts could not detect any common photoautotrophic diazotrophs , such as , [PER Trichodesmium] , but a prevalence of gamma-proteobacteria and the unicellular photoheterotrophic Group A cyanobacteria . The dominance of these likely heterotrophic diazotrophs was further verified by quantitative PCR . Hence , our combined results show that the ultra-oligotrophic [ORG SPG] harbors a hitherto unknown heterotrophic diazotrophic community , clearly distinct from other oceanic gyres previously visited .
