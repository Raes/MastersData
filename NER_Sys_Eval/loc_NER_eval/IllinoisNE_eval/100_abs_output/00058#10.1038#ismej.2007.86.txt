00058#10.1038#ismej.2007.86 Organic substrate quality as the link between bacterioplankton carbon demand and growth efficiency in a temperate salt-marsh estuary Bacterioplankton communities play a key role in aquatic carbon cycling , specifically with respect to the magnitude of organic carbon processed and partitioning of this carbon into biomass and respiratory losses . Studies of bacterioplankton carbon demand ( [ORG BCD] ) and growth efficiency ( [ORG BGE] ) frequently report higher values in more productive systems , suggesting these aspects of carbon metabolism may be positively coupled . However , the existence of such a relationship in natural aquatic systems has yet to be identified . Using a comprehensive 2-year study of bacterioplankton carbon metabolism in a temperate estuary , we investigated [ORG BCD] and [ORG BGE] and explored factors that may modulate their magnitude and coherence , including nutrient concentrations , dissolved nutrient uptake and source and quality of dissolved organic carbon ( [ORG DOC] ) . During the course of our study , [ORG BCD] ranged from 0.4 to 15.9 mug l-1 h-1 , with an overall mean of 3.8 mug l-1 h-1 . Mean [ORG BGE] was similar to that reported for other estuarine systems ( 0.32 ) and of comparable range ( that is , 0.06-0.68 ) . Initial analyses identified a negative correlation between [ORG BCD] and [ORG BGE] , yet removal of the effect of temperature revealed an underlying positive coupling that was also correlated with long-term [ORG DOC] lability . Whereas [ORG BCD] was weakly related to ambient [ORG DOC] concentrations , neither [ORG BCD] nor [ORG BGE] showed any relationship with ambient nutrient concentrations or nutrient uptake stoichiometries . We conclude that in this carbon-rich estuary , organic matter source and quality play an important role in regulating the magnitude of carbon metabolism and may be more important than nutrient availability alone in the regulation of [ORG BGE] .
