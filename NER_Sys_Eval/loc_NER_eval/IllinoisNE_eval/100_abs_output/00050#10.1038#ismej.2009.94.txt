00050#10.1038#ismej.2009.94 The complete genome sequence of the algal symbiont Dinoroseobacter shibae: a hitchhiker 's guide to life in the sea Dinoroseobacter shibae DFL12T , a member of the globally important marine [MISC Roseobacter] clade , comprises symbionts of cosmopolitan marine microalgae , including toxic dinoflagellates . Its annotated 4 417 868 bp genome sequence revealed a possible advantage of this symbiosis for the algal host . [PER D.] shibae DFL12T is able to synthesize the vitamins B1 and B12 for which its host is auxotrophic . Two pathways for the de novo synthesis of vitamin B12 are present , one requiring oxygen and the other an oxygen-independent pathway . The de novo synthesis of vitamin B12 was confirmed to be functional , and [PER D.] shibae DFL12T was shown to provide the growth-limiting vitamins B1 and B12 to its dinoflagellate host . The [MISC Roseobacter] clade has been considered to comprise obligate aerobic bacteria . However , [PER D.] shibae DFL12T is able to grow anaerobically using the alternative electron acceptors nitrate and dimethylsulfoxide ; it has the arginine deiminase survival fermentation pathway and a complex oxygen-dependent [PER Fnr] ( fumarate and nitrate reduction ) regulon . Many of these traits are shared with other members of the [MISC Roseobacter] clade . [PER D.] shibae DFL12T has five plasmids , showing examples for vertical recruitment of chromosomal genes ( thiC ) and horizontal gene transfer ( cox genes , gene cluster of 47 kb ) possibly by conjugation ( vir gene cluster ) . The long-range ( 80% ) synteny between two sister plasmids provides insights into the emergence of novel plasmids . [PER D.] shibae DFL12T shows the most complex viral defense system of all Rhodobacterales sequenced to date .
