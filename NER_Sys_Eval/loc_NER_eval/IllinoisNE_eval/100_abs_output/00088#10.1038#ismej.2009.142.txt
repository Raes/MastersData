00088#10.1038#ismej.2009.142 Distinct flavobacterial communities in contrasting water masses of the [ORG North Atlantic Ocean] Members of the class [ORG Flavobacteria] in the phylum Bacteroidetes are among the most abundant picoplankton in coastal and polar oceans . Their diversity is high in marine waters . However , quantitative information about distribution patterns of flavobacterial clades is scarce . We analyzed the diversity and clade-specific abundances of individual [ORG Flavobacteria] in different oceanic provinces in the [ORG North Atlantic Ocean] . Samples were taken along the 30degreesW meridian between the [LOC East] [LOC Greenland] current and the [ORG North Atlantic] subtropical gyre . Comparative sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) gene libraries revealed high diversity and significant spatial variability within the class [ORG Flavobacteria] . Published and newly designed oligonucleotide probes were used to enumerate eleven flavobacterial clades by catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization ( [MISC CARD-FISH] ) . We found that different provinces harbor distinct flavobacterial communities . [PER Clade DE2] accounted for a substantial fraction of total [ORG Flavobacteria] only in the [MISC Polar Biome] ( [LOC BPLR] ) , whereas the VISION clades [MISC VIS1] and VIS4 significantly increased in the [MISC Arctic] ( ARCT ) province . Members of the genus [MISC Polaribacter] were the most abundant clade in all the water masses analyzed , with highest absolute numbers in [LOC BPLR] and ARCT . We improved the [MISC CARD-FISH] protocol to quantify the rare clades VIS2 , VIS3 , [PER VIS5] and [PER VIS6] , which were present in abundances below 0.5% . They all showed pronounced regional distribution patterns . Microscopic analysis proved a specific enrichment of [ORG Flavobacteria] in the phycosphere of nanophytoplankton of [LOC BPLR] and ARCT . Our results suggest that different marine flavobacterial clades have distinct niches and different life strategies .
