00032#10.1038#ismej.2013.121 Programmed cell death in the marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium mediates carbon and nitrogen export The extent of carbon ( C ) and nitrogen ( N ) export to the deep ocean depends upon the efficacy of the biological pump that transports primary production to depth , thereby preventing its recycling in the upper photic zone . The dinitrogen-fixing ( diazotrophic ) Trichodesmium spp . contributes significantly to oceanic C and N cycling by forming extensive blooms in nutrient-poor tropical and subtropical regions . These massive blooms generally collapse several days after forming , but the cellular mechanism responsible , along with the magnitude of associated C and N export processes , are as yet unknown . Here , we used a custom-made , 2-m high water column to simulate a natural bloom and to specifically test and quantify whether the programmed cell death ( [ORG PCD] ) of Trichodesmium mechanistically regulates increased vertical flux of C and N . Our findings demonstrate that extremely rapid development and abrupt , PCD-induced demise ( within 2-3 days ) of Trichodesmium blooms lead to greatly elevated excretions of transparent exopolymers and a massive downward pulse of particulate organic matter . Our results mechanistically link autocatalytic [ORG PCD] and bloom collapse to quantitative C and N export fluxes , suggesting that [ORG PCD] may have an impact on the biological pump efficiency in the oceans .
