00007#10.1038#nrmicro956 Cell death in planktonic , photosynthetic microorganisms Phytoplankton evolved in the [MISC Archaean] oceans more than 2.8 billion years ago and are of crucial importance in regulating aquatic food webs , biogeochemical cycles and the [LOC Earth] 's climate . Until recently , phytoplankton were considered immortal unless killed or eaten by predators . However , over the past decade , it has become clear that these organisms can either be infected by viruses or undergo programmed cell death ( [ORG PCD] ) in response to environmental stress , resulting in mortality . Here , we discuss exogenous and endogenous mechanisms of phytoplankton death , specifically examining the experimental evidence for [ORG PCD] in phytoplankton and exploring its evolutionary development and ecological impact . We consider phytoplankton [ORG PCD] as an autocatalytic cell-suicide mechanism in which an endogenous biochemical pathway leads to cellular demise with apoptotic morphological changes . Phytoplankton have a core set of proteins that are orthologues of metazoan caspases . It seems that [ORG PCD] in prokaryotic phytoplankton , and in independently evolving eukaryotic lineages , has deeply rooted origins that were appropriated and transferred to multicellular plants and animals in the past 700 million years of the [LOC Earth] 's history .
