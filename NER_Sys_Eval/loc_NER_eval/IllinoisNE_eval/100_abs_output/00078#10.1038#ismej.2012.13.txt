00078#10.1038#ismej.2012.13 Molecular evidence of iron limitation and availability in the global diazotroph [MISC Trichodesmium] The activity of the [MISC N2-fixing] cyanobacterial genus [MISC Trichodesmium] is critical to the global nitrogen ( N ) and carbon ( C ) cycles . Although iron ( Fe ) has been shown to be an important element limiting the growth and [MISC N2] fixation of [MISC Trichodesmium] , there have been no specific data demonstrating the in situ affect of Fe on [MISC Trichodesmium] . We surveyed [MISC Trichodesmium] populations from the [LOC Atlantic] and [LOC Pacific Oceans] for Fe limitation using a novel quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR ( qRT-PCR ) method monitoring the expression of an Fe limitation-induced gene , isiB . Here we report the first molecular evidence of in situ Fe limitation of [MISC Trichodesmium N2] fixation , which was evident in samples from the [LOC Pacific Ocean] , whereas limitation appeared minimal to nonexistent in [LOC Atlantic Ocean] samples . As our method is [MISC Trichodesmium] clade specific , we were also able to determine that representatives from the [MISC Trichodesmium] tenue clade were the most biologically active group of [MISC Trichodesmium] in the majority of our samples , which speaks to their dominance in open ocean regimes . Furthermore , comparisons of our field expression and chemical data with laboratory studies suggest that the majority of dissolved Fe in the open ocean is available to [MISC Trichodesmium] colonies regardless of Fe complexation .
