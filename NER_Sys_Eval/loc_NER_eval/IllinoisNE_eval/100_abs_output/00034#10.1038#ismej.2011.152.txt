00034#10.1038#ismej.2011.152 Analogous nutrient limitations in unicellular diazotrophs and [ORG Prochlorococcus] in the [MISC South] [LOC Pacific Ocean] Growth limitation of phytoplankton and unicellular nitrogen ( N2 ) fixers ( diazotrophs ) were investigated in the oligotrophic [LOC Western] [MISC South] [LOC Pacific Ocean] . Based on change in abundances of nifH or 23S rRNA gene copies during nutrient-enrichment experiments , the factors limiting net growth of the unicellular diazotrophs [ORG UCYN-A] ( Group A ) , [PER Crocosphaera] watsonii , gamma-Proteobacterium 24774A11 , and the non-diazotrophic picocyanobacterium [ORG Prochlorococcus] , varied within the region . At the westernmost stations , numbers were enhanced by organic carbon added as simple sugars , a combination of iron and an organic chelator , or iron added with phosphate . At stations nearest the equator , the nutrient-limiting growth was not apparent . Maximum net growth rates for [ORG UCYN-A] , [PER C. watsonii] and gamma-24774A11 were 0.19 , 0.61 and 0.52 d-1 , respectively , which are the first known empirical growth rates reported for the uncultivated [ORG UCYN-A] and the gamma-24774A11 . The addition of N enhanced total phytoplankton biomass up to 5-fold , and the non-N2-fixing [MISC Synechococcus] was among the groups that responded favorably to N addition . Nitrogen was the major nutrient-limiting phytoplankton biomass in the [LOC Western South] [LOC Pacific Ocean] , while availability of organic carbon or iron and organic chelator appear to limit abundances of unicellular diazotrophs . Lack of phytoplankton response to nutrient additions in the [LOC Pacific] warm pool waters suggests diazotroph growth in this area is controlled by different factors than in the higher latitudes , which may partially explain previously observed variability in community composition in the region .
