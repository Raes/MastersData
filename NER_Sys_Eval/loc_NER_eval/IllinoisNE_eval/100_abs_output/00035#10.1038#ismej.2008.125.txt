00035#10.1038#ismej.2008.125 Viral lysis of [MISC Phaeocystis] pouchetii: Implications for algal population dynamics and heterotrophic C , N and P cycling A model ecosystem with two autotrophic flagellates , [MISC Phaeocystis] pouchetii and [MISC Rhodomonas] salina , a virus specific to [PER P. pouchetii] ( [ORG PpV] ) and bacteria and heterotrophic nanoflagellates was used to investigate effects of viral lysis on algal population dynamics and heterotrophic nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization . Lysis of [PER P. pouchetii] by [ORG PpV] had strong positive effects on bacterial and [ORG HNF] abundance , and the mass balance of C , N and P suggested an efficient transfer of organic material from [PER P.] pouchetii to bacterial and [ORG HNF] biomass through viral lysis . At the same time , the degradation of [PER P.] pouchetii lysates was associated with significant regeneration of inorganic N and P resulting in 148 mug N l-1 and 7 mug P l-1 , corresponding to 78% and 26% of lysate N and P being mineralized to [MISC NH4+] and PO43- , respectively . These results showed that the turnover of viral lysates in the microbial food web was associated with significant N and P mineralization , supporting the current view that viral lysates can be an important source of inorganic nutrients in marine systems . In the presence of [MISC R.] salina , the generated [MISC NH4+] supported 11% of the observed [MISC R.] salina growth . Regrowth of virus-resistant [PER P. pouchetii] following cell lysis was observed in long-term incubations ( 150 days ) , and possibly influenced by nutrient availability and competition from [PER R. salina] . The observed impact of viral activity on autotrophic and heterotrophic processes provides direct experimental evidence for virus-driven nutrient generation and emphasizes the potential importance of the viral activity in supporting marine primary production .
