00092#10.1038#ismej.2011.157 Magnitude and regulation of bacterioplankton respiratory quotient across freshwater environmental gradients Bacterioplankton respiration ( [ORG BR] ) may represent the largest single sink of organic carbon in the biosphere and constitutes an important driver of atmospheric carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions from freshwaters . Complete understanding of [ORG BR] is precluded by the fact that most studies need to assume a respiratory quotient ( RQ ; mole of CO2 produced per mole of [MISC O2] consumed ) to calculate rates of [ORG BR] . Many studies have , without clear support , assumed a fixed RQ around 1 . Here we present 72 direct measurements of bacterioplankton RQ that we carried out in epilimnetic samples of 52 freshwater sites in [LOC Quebec] ( [LOC Canada] ) , using [MISC O2] and CO2 optic sensors . The [MISC RQs] tended to converge around 1.2 , but showed large variability ( s.d.=0.45 ) and significant correlations with major gradients of ecosystem-level , substrate-level and bacterial community-level characteristics . Experiments with natural bacterioplankton using different single substrates suggested that RQ is intimately linked to the elemental composition of the respired compounds . [MISC RQs] were on average low in net autotrophic systems , where bacteria likely were utilizing mainly reduced substrates , whereas we found evidence that the dominance of highly oxidized substrates , for example , organic acids formed by photo-chemical processes , led to high RQ in the more heterotrophic systems . Further , we suggest that [ORG BR] contributes to a substantially larger share of freshwater CO2 emissions than presently believed based on the assumption that RQ is ~1 . Our study demonstrates that bacterioplankton RQ is not only a practical aspect of [ORG BR] determination , but also a major ecosystem state variable that provides unique information about aquatic ecosystem functioning .
