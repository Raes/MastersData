00080#10.1038#ismej.2010.36 Significant CO2 fixation by small prymnesiophytes in the subtropical and tropical northeast [LOC Atlantic Ocean] Global estimates indicate the oceans are responsible for approximately half of the carbon dioxide fixed on [LOC Earth] . [ORG Organisms] 5 mum in size dominate open ocean phytoplankton communities in terms of abundance and CO2 fixation , with the cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus numerically the most abundant and more extensively studied compared with small eukaryotes . However , the contribution of specific taxonomic groups to marine CO2 fixation is still poorly known . In this study , we show that among the phytoplankton , small eukaryotes contribute significantly to CO2 fixation ( 44% ) because of their larger cell volume and thereby higher cell-specific CO2 fixation rates . Within the eukaryotes , two groups , herein called [ORG Euk-A] and [ORG Euk-B] , were distinguished based on their flow cytometric signature . [ORG Euk-A] , the most abundant group , contained cells 1.8+/-0.1 mum in size while [ORG Euk-B] was the least abundant but cells were larger ( 2.8+/-0.2 mum ) . The [ORG Euk-B] group comprising prymnesiophytes ( 73+/-13% ) belonging largely to lineages with no close cultured counterparts accounted for up to 38% of the total primary production in the subtropical and tropical northeast [LOC Atlantic Ocean] , suggesting a key role of this group in oceanic CO2 fixation .
