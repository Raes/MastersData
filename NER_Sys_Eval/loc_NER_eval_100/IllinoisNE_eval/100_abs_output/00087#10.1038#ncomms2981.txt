00087#10.1038#ncomms2981 Role of biogenic silica in the removal of iron from the [MISC Antarctic] seas [LOC Iron] has a key role in controlling biological production in the [LOC Southern Ocean] , yet the mechanisms regulating iron availability in this and other ocean regions are not completely understood . Here , based on analysis of living phytoplankton in the coastal seas of [LOC West Antarctica] , we present a new pathway for iron removal from marine systems involving structural incorporation of reduced , organic iron into biogenic silica . Export of iron incorporated into biogenic silica may represent a substantial unaccounted loss of iron from marine systems . For example , in the [LOC Ross Sea] , burial of iron incorporated into biogenic silica is conservatively estimated as 11 mumol m-2 per year , which is in the same range as the major bioavailable iron inputs to this region . As a major sink of bioavailable iron , incorporation of iron into biogenic silica may shift microbial population structure towards taxa with relatively lower iron requirements , and may reduce ecosystem productivity and associated carbon sequestration .
