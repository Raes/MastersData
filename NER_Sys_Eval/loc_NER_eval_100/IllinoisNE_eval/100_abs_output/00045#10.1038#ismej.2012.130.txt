00045#10.1038#ismej.2012.130 Gradients in microbial methanol uptake: productive coastal upwelling waters to oligotrophic gyres in the [LOC Atlantic Ocean] Methanol biogeochemistry and its importance as a carbon source in seawater is relatively unexplored . We report the first microbial methanol carbon assimilation rates ( k ) in productive coastal upwelling waters of up to 0.117+/-0.002 d-1 ( ~10 nmol l-1 d-1 ) . On average , coastal upwelling waters were 11 times greater than open ocean northern temperate ( [LOC NT] ) waters , eight times greater than gyre waters and four times greater than equatorial upwelling ( [ORG EU] ) waters ; suggesting that all upwelling waters upon reaching the surface ( 20 m ) , contain a microbial population that uses a relatively high amount of carbon ( 0.3-10 nmol l-1 d-1 ) , derived from methanol , to support their growth . In open ocean [LOC Atlantic] regions , microbial uptake of methanol into biomass was significantly lower , ranging between 0.04-0.68 nmol l-1 d-1 . Microbes in the [MISC Mauritanian] coastal upwelling used up to 57% of the total methanol for assimilation of the carbon into cells , compared with an average of 12% in the [ORG EU] , and 1% in [LOC NT] and gyre waters . Several methylotrophic bacterial species were identified from open ocean [LOC Atlantic] waters using PCR amplification of mxaF encoding methanol dehydrogenase , the key enzyme in bacterial methanol oxidation . These included [PER Methylophaga] sp. , Burkholderiales sp. , Methylococcaceae sp. , Ancylobacter aquaticus , Paracoccus denitrificans , Methylophilus methylotrophus , Methylobacterium oryzae , [PER Hyphomicrobium] sp . and [MISC Methylosulfonomonas] methylovora . Statistically significant correlations for upwelling waters between methanol uptake into cells and both chlorophyll a concentrations and methanol oxidation rates suggest that remotely sensed chlorophyll a images , in these productive areas , could be used to derive total methanol biological loss rates , a useful tool for atmospheric and marine climatically active gas modellers , and air-sea exchange scientists .
