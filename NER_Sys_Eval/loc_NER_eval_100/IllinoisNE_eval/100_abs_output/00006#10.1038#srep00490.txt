00006#10.1038#srep00490 Metagenomes of [MISC Mediterranean Coastal] [ORG Lagoons] [ORG Coastal] lagoons , both hypersaline and freshwater , are common , but still understudied ecosystems . We describe , for the first time , using high throughput sequencing , the extant microbiota of two large and representative [MISC Mediterranean] coastal lagoons , the hypersaline Mar Menor , and the freshwater [ORG Albufera de Valencia] , both located on the south eastern coast of [LOC Spain] . We show there are considerable differences in the microbiota of both lagoons , in comparison to other marine and freshwater habitats . Importantly , a novel uncultured sulfur oxidizing [MISC Alphaproteobacteria] was found to dominate bacterioplankton in the hypersaline Mar Menor . Also , in the latter prokaryotic cyanobacteria were almost exclusively comprised by Synechococcus and no [MISC Prochlorococcus] was found . Remarkably , the microbial community in the freshwaters of the hypertrophic [ORG Albufera] was completely in contrast to known freshwater systems , in that there was a near absence of well known and cosmopolitan groups of ultramicrobacteria namely Low GC Actinobacteria and the [MISC LD12] lineage of [MISC Alphaproteobacteria] .
