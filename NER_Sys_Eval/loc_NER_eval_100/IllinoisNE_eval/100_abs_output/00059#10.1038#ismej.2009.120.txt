00059#10.1038#ismej.2009.120 Efficient aquatic bacterial metabolism of dissolved low-molecular-weight compounds from terrestrial sources Carboxylic acids ( CAs ) , amino acids ( AAs ) and carbohydrates ( [ORG CHs] ) in dissolved free forms can be readily assimilated by aquatic bacteria and metabolized at high growth efficiencies . Previous studies have shown that these low-molecular-weight ( [ORG LMW] ) substrates are released by phytoplankton but also that unidentified [ORG LMW] compounds of terrestrial origin is a subsidy for bacterial metabolism in unproductive freshwater systems . We tested the hypothesis that different terrestrially derived [ORG CA] , [LOC AA] and CH compounds can offer substantial support for aquatic bacterial metabolism in fresh waters that are dominated by allochthonous dissolved organic matter ( [ORG DOM] ) . Drainage water from three catchments of different characters in the [MISC Krycklan] experimental area in [LOC Northern] [LOC Sweden] were studied at the rising and falling limb of the spring flood , using a 2-week bioassay approach . A variety of [ORG CA] , [LOC AA] and CH compounds were significantly assimilated by bacteria , meeting 15-100% of the bacterial carbon demand and explaining most of the observed variation in bacterial growth efficiency ( [ORG BGE] ; R2=0.66 ) . Of the 29 chemical species that was detected , acetate was the most important , representing 45% of the total bacterial consumption of all [ORG LMW] compounds . We suggest that [ORG LMW] organic compounds in boreal spring flood drainage could potentially support all in situ bacterial production in receiving lake waters during periods of weeks to months after the spring flood .
