00048#10.1038#ismej.2008.117 Seasonal dynamics of [MISC SAR11] populations in the euphotic and mesopelagic zones of the northwestern [LOC Sargasso Sea] Bacterioplankton belonging to the [MISC SAR11] clade of a-proteobacteria were counted by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) over eight depths in the surface 300 m at the [LOC Bermuda] [ORG Atlantic Time-series Study] ( [MISC BATS] ) site from 2003 to 2005 . [MISC SAR11] are dominant heterotrophs in oligotrophic systems ; thus , resolving their temporal dynamics can provide important insights to the cycling of organic and inorganic nutrients . This quantitative time-series data revealed distinct annual distribution patterns of [MISC SAR11] abundance in the euphotic ( 0-120 ) and upper mesopelagic ( 160-300 m ) zones that were reproducibly correlated with seasonal mixing and stratification of the water column . Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism ( T-RFLP ) data generated from a decade of samples collected at [MISC BATS] were combined with the FISH data to model the annual dynamics of [MISC SAR11] subclade populations . 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed to verify the correlation of the T-RFLP data with [MISC SAR11] clade structure . [ORG Clear] vertical and temporal transitions were observed in the dominance of three [MISC SAR11] ecotypes . The mechanisms that lead to shifts between the different [MISC SAR11] populations are not well understood , but are probably a consequence of finely tuned physiological adaptations that partition the populations along physical and chemical gradients in the ecosystem . The correlation between evolutionary descent and temporal/spatial patterns we describe , confirmed that a minimum of three [MISC SAR11] ecotypes occupy the [LOC Sargasso Sea] surface layer , and revealed new details of their population dynamics .
