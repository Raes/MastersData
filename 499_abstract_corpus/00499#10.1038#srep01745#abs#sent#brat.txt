Diverse stoichiometry of dissolved trace metals in the Indian Ocean
Trace metals in seawater are essential to organisms and important as tracers of various processes in the ocean.
However, we do not have a good understanding of the global distribution and cycling of trace metals, especially in the Indian Ocean.
Here we report the first simultaneous, full-depth, and basin-scale section-distribution of dissolved (D) Al, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in the Indian Ocean.
Our data reveal widespread co-limitation for phytoplankton production by DFe and occurrence of redox-related processes.
The stoichiometry of the DM/phosphorus ratio agrees within a factor of 5 between deep waters in the Indian and Pacific, whereas it shows variability up to a factor of 300 among water masses within the Indian Ocean.
This indicates that a consistent mechanism controls the stoichiometry in the deep waters, which are significantly depleted in Mn, Fe, and Co compared to requirements for phytoplankton.
