Global distribution patterns of distinct clades of the photosynthetic picoeukaryote Ostreococcus
Ostreococcus is a marine picophytoeukaryote for which culture studies indicate there are 'high-light' and 'low-light' adapted ecotypes.
Representatives of these ecotypes fall within two to three 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) clades for the former and one for the latter.
However, clade distributions and relationships to this form of niche partitioning are unknown in nature.
We developed two quantitative PCR primer-probe sets and enumerated the proposed ecotypes in the Pacific Ocean as well as the subtropical and tropical North Atlantic.
Statistical differences in factors such as salinity, temperature and NO3 indicated the ecophysiological parameters behind clade distributions are more complex than irradiance alone.
Clade OII, containing the putatively low-light adapted strains, was detected at warm oligotrophic sites.
In contrast, Clade OI, containing high-light adapted strains, was present in cooler mesotrophic and coastal waters.
Maximal OI abundance (19 555+/-37 18S rDNA copies per ml) was detected in mesotrophic waters at 40 m depth, approaching the nutricline.
OII was often more abundant at the deep chlorophyll maximum, when nutrient concentrations were significantly higher than at the surface (stratified euphotic zone waters).
However, in mixed euphotic-zone water columns, relatively high numbers (for example, 891+/-107 18S rDNA copies per ml, Sargasso Sea, springtime) were detected at the surface.
Both Clades OI and OII were found at multiple euphotic zone depths, but co-occurrence at the same geographical location appeared rare and was detected only in continental slope waters.
In situ growth rate estimates using these primer-probes and better comprehension of physiology will enhance ecological understanding of Ostreococcus Clades OII and OI which appear to be oceanic and coastal clades, respectively.
