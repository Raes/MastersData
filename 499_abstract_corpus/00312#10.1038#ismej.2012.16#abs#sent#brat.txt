Archaea in metazoan diets: implications for food webs and biogeochemical cycling
Although the importance of trophic linkages, including 'top-down forcing', on energy flow and ecosystem productivity is recognized, the influence of metazoan grazing on Archaea and the biogeochemical processes that they mediate is unknown.
Here, we test if: (1) Archaea provide a food source sufficient to allow metazoan fauna to complete their life cycle; (2) neutral lipid biomarkers (including crocetane) can be used to identify Archaea consumers; and (3) archaeal aggregates are a dietary source for methane seep metazoans.
In the laboratory, we demonstrated that a dorvilleid polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, can complete its life cycle on two strains of Euryarchaeota with the same growth rate as when fed bacterial and eukaryotic food.
Archaea were therefore confirmed as a digestible and nutritious food source sufficient to sustain metazoan populations.
Both strains of Euryarchaeota used as food sources had unique lipids that were not incorporated into O. labronica tissues.
At methane seeps, sulfate-reducing bacteria that form aggregations and live syntrophically with anaerobic-methane oxidizing Archaea contain isotopically and structurally unique fatty acids (FAs).
These biomarkers were incorporated into tissues of an endolithofaunal dorvilleid polychaete species from Costa Rica (mean bulk delta13C=-92+/-4/1000; polar lipids -116/1000) documenting consumption of archaeal-bacterial aggregates.
FA composition of additional soft-sediment methane seep species from Oregon and California provided evidence that consumption of archaeal-bacterial aggregates is widespread at methane seeps.
This work is the first to show that Archaea are consumed by heterotrophic metazoans, a trophic process we coin as 'archivory'.
