The microbial ecology of permafrost
Permafrost constitutes a major portion of the terrestrial cryosphere of the Earth and is a unique ecological niche for cold-adapted microorganisms.
There is a relatively high microbial diversity in permafrost, although there is some variation in community composition across different permafrost features and between sites.
Some microorganisms are even active at subzero temperatures in permafrost.
An emerging concern is the impact of climate change and the possibility of subsequent permafrost thaw promoting microbial activity in permafrost, resulting in increased potential for greenhouse-gas emissions.
This Review describes new data on the microbial ecology of permafrost and provides a platform for understanding microbial life strategies in frozen soil as well as the impact of climate change on permafrost microorganisms and their functional roles.
