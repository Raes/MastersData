The climate of the western shelf of LOC the Antarctic Peninsula  (WAP) is undergoing a transition from a cold-dry polar-type climate to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic–type climate.
Using DATE three decades  of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the ORG WAP  shelf.
Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated ORG Chl  a PERCENT ~63%  of DATE annually  integrated Chl a) declined by PERCENT 12%  along the ORG WAP  over DATE the past 30 years , with the largest decreases equatorward of CARDINAL 63 PRODUCT °S  and with substantial increases in ORG Chl  a occurring farther south.
The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing.
Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (Euphausia superba) and penguin populations.
