The formation of calcareous skeletons by marine planktonic organisms and their subsequent sinking to depth generates a continuous rain of calcium carbonate to the deep ocean and underlying sediments.<br>This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange.<br>The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry.<br>Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae, but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms.<br>Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids <font style="background-color: #88FF88"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2903&mode=info">Emiliania huxleyi</a></font> and Gephyrocapsa oceanica.<br>This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres.<br>Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production.<br>Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels.<br>We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean.<br>As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.<br><p><hr><p><b><a href="http://130.88.91.13/cgi-bin/search?q=10.1126#science.1154122#abs#brat">10.1126#science.1154122#abs#brat</a></b><br>
Ocean acidification in response to rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressures is widely expected to reduce calcification by marine organisms.<br>From the mid-Mesozoic, coccolithophores have been major calcium carbonate producers in the world’s oceans, today accounting for about a third of the total marine CaCO3 production.<br>Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species <font style="background-color: #88FF88"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2903&mode=info">Emiliania huxleyi</a></font> are significantly increased by high CO2 partial pressures.<br>Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40% increase in average coccolith mass.<br>Our findings show that coccolithophores are already responding and will probably continue to respond to rising atmospheric CO2 partial pressures, which has important implications for biogeochemical modeling of future oceans and climate.<br><p><hr><p><b><a href="http://130.88.91.13/cgi-bin/search?q=10.1126#science.1164533#abs#brat">10.1126#science.1164533#abs#brat</a></b><br>
The climate of the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is undergoing a transition from a cold-dry polar-type climate to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic–type climate.<br>Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the WAP shelf.<br>Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated Chl a ~63% of annually integrated Chl a) declined by 12% along the WAP over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of 63°S and with substantial increases in Chl a occurring farther south.<br>The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing.<br>Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (<font style="background-color: #88FF88"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=6819&mode=info">Euphausia superba</a></font>) and penguin populations.<br><p><hr><p><b><a href="http://130.88.91.13/cgi-bin/search?q=10.1371#journal.pone.0061868#abs#brat">10.1371#journal.pone.0061868#abs#brat</a></b><br>
Ocean acidification due to rising atmospheric CO2 is expected to affect the physiology of important calcifying marine organisms, but the nature and magnitude of change is yet to be established.<br>In coccolithophores, different species and strains display varying calcification responses to ocean acidification, but the underlying biochemical properties remain unknown.<br>We employed an approach combining tandem mass-spectrometry with isobaric tagging (iTRAQ) and multiple database searching to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in cells of the marine coccolithophore species <font style="background-color: #88FF88"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2903&mode=info">Emiliania huxleyi</a></font> (strain NZEH) between two CO2 conditions: 395 (~current day) and ~1340 p.p.m.v. CO2.<br>Cells exposed to the higher CO2 condition contained more cellular particulate inorganic carbon (CaCO3) and particulate organic nitrogen and carbon than those maintained in present-day conditions.<br>These results are linked with the observation that cells grew slower under elevated CO2, indicating cell cycle disruption.<br>Under high CO2 conditions, coccospheres were larger and cells possessed bigger coccoliths that did not show any signs of malformation compared to those from cells grown under present-day CO2 levels.<br>No differences in calcification rate, particulate organic carbon production or cellular organic carbon:nitrogen ratios were observed.<br>Results were not related to nutrient limitation or acclimation status of cells.<br>At least 46 homologous protein groups from a variety of functional processes were quantified in these experiments, of which four (histones H2A, H3, H4 and a chloroplastic 30S ribosomal protein S7) showed down-regulation in all replicates exposed to high CO2, perhaps reflecting the decrease in growth rate.<br>We present evidence of cellular stress responses but proteins associated with many key metabolic processes remained unaltered.<br>Our results therefore suggest that this <font style="background-color: #88FF88"><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2903&mode=info">E. huxleyi</a></font> strain possesses some acclimation mechanisms to tolerate future CO2 scenarios, although the observed decline in growth rate may be an overriding factor affecting the success of this ecotype in future oceans.<br><p><hr><p></body></html>
