Geotext

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/geotext

Geotext is a python import that extracts country and city mentions from text.

Text has to be presented as a single string, this could increase parsing overhead by a great deal on large texts. (Paragraph breaks are considered to be breaking the single string)

As we are out after more general locations than simply country/city I do not believe Geotext will be useful for us.
