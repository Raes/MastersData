Geotxt

Geotxt is a simple web interface that allows you to input an article of text and it will find mentions of locations. You can choose between these systems;

Geotxt w/ Stanford NER & improved ranking
Geotxt w/ GATE & improved ranking
Geotxt w/ Stanford NER & disambiguation
Geotxt w/ GATE & disambiguation
Geotxt w/ Stanford NER engine
Geotxt w/ GATE engine

Here we used Stanford NER & Improved ranking (looked at GATE but results were the same)

Result: Seems capable of the very basics but unable to find more complex locations and longer articles returned no results.
