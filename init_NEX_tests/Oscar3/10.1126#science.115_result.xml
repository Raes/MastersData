Here, we present laboratory evidence that calcification and net primary production in the coccolithophore species Emiliania huxleyi are significantly increased by high <ne id="o6" surface="CO2" type="CM" confidence="0.6922710149508499">CO2</ne> partial pressures. Field evidence from the deep ocean is consistent with these laboratory conclusions, indicating that over the past 220 years there has been a 40% increase in average coccolith <ne id="o7" surface="mass" type="ONT" ontIDs="FIX:0000479" rightPunct=".">mass</ne>.
