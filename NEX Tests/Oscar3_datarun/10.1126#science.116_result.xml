<PAPER><BODY><DIV><HEADER/><P>The climate of the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (<ne id="o1" surface="WAP" type="CM" confidence="0.22668839536224208" leftPunct="(" rightPunct=")">WAP</ne>) is undergoing a transition from a cold-dry polar-type climate to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic–type climate. Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from <ne id="o2" surface="chlorophyll" type="CM" confidence="0.3757877164189128" ontIDs="CHEBI:28966">chlorophyll</ne> a concentration (Chl a), has significantly changed along the <ne id="o4" surface="WAP" type="CM" confidence="0.245657691147499">WAP</ne> shelf. Summertime surface Chl a (summer integrated Chl a ~63% of annually integrated Chl a) declined by 12% along the <ne id="o5" surface="WAP" type="CM" confidence="0.23706110181827986">WAP</ne> over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of <ne id="o6" surface="63°S" type="CM" confidence="0.3023492166056711">63°S</ne> and with substantial increases in Chl a occurring farther south. The latitudinal variation in Chl a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting <ne id="o7" surface="water" type="CM" confidence="0.9780958015009693" rightPunct="-" SMILES="O" InChI="InChI=1/H2O/h1H2" ontIDs="CHEBI:15377">water</ne>-column mixing. Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (Euphausia superba) and penguin populations. </P></DIV></BODY><cmlPile/></PAPER>
