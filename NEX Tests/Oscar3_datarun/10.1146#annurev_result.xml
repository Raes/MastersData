This primary production supports essentially <ne id="o3" surface="all" type="ONT" ontIDs="CHEBI:37690">all</ne> life in the oceans and profoundly affects global biogeochemical cycles and climate. This review discusses the general distribution of primary production in the sea, the processes that regulate this distribution, and how <ne id="o4" surface="marine" type="CM" confidence="0.20348450534692414">marine</ne> primary production is sensitive to climate variability and change. Statistical modes of ocean variability and their characteristic interannual to multi-decadal timescales over the last century are described. Recent in situ and satellite time-series of primary production can be clearly linked to interannual ocean variability.
