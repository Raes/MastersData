<PAPER><BODY><DIV><HEADER/><P>Changes in oceanic primary production, linked to changes in the network of global biogeochemical cycles, have profoundly influenced the geochemistry of Earth for over 3 billion years. In the contemporary ocean, photosynthetic <ne id="o1" surface="carbon" type="CM" confidence="0.9793182707017568" Element="C">carbon</ne> fixation by <ne id="o2" surface="marine" type="CM" confidence="0.20544282349269477">marine</ne> phytoplankton leads to formation of 45 gigatons of organic <ne id="o3" surface="carbon" type="CM" confidence="0.9841370188332658" Element="C">carbon</ne> per annum, of which 16 gigatons are exported to the ocean interior. Changes in the magnitude of total and export production can strongly influence atmospheric <ne id="o4" surface="CO2" type="CM" confidence="0.8070202675168012">CO2</ne> levels (and hence climate) on geological time scales, as well as set upper bounds for sustainable fisheries harvest. The two fluxes are critically dependent on geophysical processes that determine mixed-layer depth, <ne id="o5" surface="nutrient" type="ONT" ontIDs="CHEBI:33284">nutrient</ne> fluxes to and within the ocean, and <ne id="o6" surface="food" type="ONT" ontIDs="CHEBI:33290" rightPunct="-">food</ne>-web <ne id="o7" surface="structure" type="ONT" ontIDs="FIX:0000482" rightPunct=".">structure</ne>. Because the average turnover time of phytoplankton <ne id="o8" surface="carbon" type="CM" confidence="0.9953275733316725" Element="C">carbon</ne> in the ocean is on the order of a week or less, total and export production are extremely sensitive to external forcing and consequently are seldom in steady state. Elucidating the biogeochemical controls and feedbacks on primary production is essential to understanding how oceanic biota responded to and affected natural climatic variability in the geological past, and will respond to anthropogenically influenced changes in coming decades. One of the most crucial feedbacks results from changes in radiative forcing on the hydrological cycle, which influences the aeolian <ne id="o9" surface="iron" type="CM" confidence="0.9293592827379673" Element="Fe">iron</ne> flux and, in turn, affects <ne id="o10" surface="nitrogen" type="CM" confidence="0.9911196801009414" Element="N" ontIDs="CHEBI:33267 CHEBI:25555">nitrogen</ne> fixation and primary production in the oceans. </P></DIV></BODY><cmlPile/></PAPER>
