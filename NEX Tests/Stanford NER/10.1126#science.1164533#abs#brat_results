The climate of the western shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) is undergoing a transition from a cold-dry polar-type climate to a warm-humid sub-Antarctic–type climate. Using three decades of satellite and field data, we document that ocean biological productivity, inferred from chlorophyll a concentration (<ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a), has significantly changed along the <ORGANIZATION>WAP</ORGANIZATION> shelf. Summertime surface <ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a (<DATE>summer</DATE> integrated <ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a ~<PERCENT>63%</PERCENT> of annually integrated <ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a) declined by <PERCENT>12%</PERCENT> along the WAP over the past 30 years, with the largest decreases equatorward of 63°S and with substantial increases in <ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a occurring farther south. The latitudinal variation in <ORGANIZATION>Chl</ORGANIZATION> a trends reflects shifting patterns of ice cover, cloud formation, and windiness affecting water-column mixing. Regional changes in phytoplankton coincide with observed changes in krill (<LOCATION>Euphausia</LOCATION> superba) and penguin populations.
