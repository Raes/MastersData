Linnaeus 2.0

http://linnaeus.sourceforge.net/

Biological Species, dictionary driven. Is able to generate new dictionaries if given proper information.
Currently uses species dictionary from MEDLINE, but maybe we could expand using well known biological species ontologies?

Easy to use, able to perform matching using default or given configuration. Able to work on sets of documents with different
output formats.
