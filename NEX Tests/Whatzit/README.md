Dictionary based tagger for different entities. Unfortunately most of the pipelines are either dead or non-responsive. WhatizitOrganisms was responsive but further linking to the taxonomies was dead.

Due to the age of the system and the amount of dead links/information I will consider this system as DEAD.
