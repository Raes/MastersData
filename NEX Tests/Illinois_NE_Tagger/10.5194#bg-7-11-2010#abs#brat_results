As part of the ORG US-AMLR  program in January-February of DATE 2006 , CARDINAL 99  stations in the LOC South Shetland Islands-Antarctic Peninsula region  were sampled to understand the variability in hydrographic and biological properties related to the abundance and distribution of krill in this area. 
Concentrations of dissolved iron (DFe) and total acid-leachable iron (TaLFe) were measured in the upper 150m at CARDINAL 16  of these stations (both coastal and pelagic waters) to better resolve the factors limiting primary production in this area and in downstream waters of LOC the Scotia Sea . 
The concentrations of PERSON DFe  and PERSON TaLFe  in the upper mixed layer (ORG UML ) were relatively high in LOC Weddell Sea Shelf  PERSON Waters  (∼QUANTITY 0.6 nM  and QUANTITY 15 nM , respectively) and low in ORG Drake Passage waters  (∼0.2nM and 0.9nM, respectively). 
In LOC the Bransfield Strait , representing a mixture of waters from LOC the Weddell Sea  and the ORG Antarctic Circumpolar Current  (ORG ACC ), concentrations of PERSON DFe  were ∼CARDINAL 0.4  nM and of GPE TaLFe  ∼QUANTITY 1.7 nM . 
The highest concentrations of PERSON DFe  and PERSON TaLFe  in the ORG UML  were found at shallow coastal stations close to LOC Livingston Island  (∼QUANTITY 1.6 nM and 100 nM , respectively). 
The ratio of TaLFe:DFe varied with the distance to land: ∼CARDINAL 45  at the shallow coastal stations, ∼CARDINAL 15  in the high-salinity waters of LOC Bransfield Strait , and ∼CARDINAL 4  in ORG ACC  waters. 
Concentrations of DFe increased slightly with depth in the water column, while that of TaLFe did not show any consistent trend with depth. 
Our Fe data are discussed in regard to the hydrography and water circulation patterns in the study area, and with the hypothesis that the relatively high rates of primary production in the central regions of ORG the Scotia Sea  are partially sustained by natural iron enrichment resulting from a northeasterly flow of iron-rich coastal waters originating in the LOC South Shetland Islands-Antarctic Peninsula  region.
