LingPipe system v4.1.0

http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/web/demo-ne.html

LingPipe has a location entity extraction feature that I would have liked to test. However their online demo is not currently
working (I get no response from the web link) and because of time constraints have not set up the whole system.
